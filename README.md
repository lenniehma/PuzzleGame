Concept: 
- Player must navigate through a maze to end goal in under x rounds.
- At the end of each round, the player turns back time and starts from the previous round's end location.
- During each subsequent round, the previous rounds' players--or now clones--repeat their movements while the latest player continues to go through the maze.
- Throughout the maze, there are buttons that must be continuously pressed in order to open their corresponding gates. These buttons can be activated by both players or the clones.
- The current player must not be seen by previous rounds' players, otherwise the current round resets (inspired by Time-Turners in Harry Potter where the importance of not being seen while travelling back in time is stressed).

To-Do:
- Bound the player's movements to the maze grounds.
- Add clone detection cone.
- Test the button functionality.
